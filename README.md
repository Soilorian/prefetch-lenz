# COMPACT: Comprehensive Prefetching Algorithm Framework

A modular Python simulation framework for developing and evaluating hardware prefetching algorithms. Use it to test new prefetching ideas on your laptop instead of in hardware simulation.

---

## Why You'd Use This

Hardware prefetching bridges the gap between processor speed and memory latency. But building and testing new prefetching strategies usually means:

- Running expensive hardware simulations  
- Using full system emulators or building prototypes
- Waiting months before you can evaluate your idea

COMPACT changes that. You run fast, software-based simulations on your laptop. You write new algorithms in Python. You iterate and compare strategies in hours, not months. No custom hardware needed.

---

## What's Inside

- 27+ algorithms spanning simple stride-based to deep learning approaches
- Modular design so you add your own algorithms
- YAML configs for parameter tuning without code changes
- Support for memory traces, synthetic workloads, and programmatic access patterns
- Analysis that measures prefetch accuracy, timeliness, and efficiency
- Pure Python with NumPy as the only external dependency
- Clean abstract base classes for extending the framework

---

## Implemented Algorithms

COMPACT includes 27+ algorithms organized by approach.

### Stride and Stream Based

- Linear Prefetcher: Detects and prefetches sequential address streams
- Strided Prefetcher: Identifies fixed-stride patterns like array rows or columns
- Best-Offset Prefetcher: Learns the best prefetch offset per program counter

### Correlation and History Based

- Markov Predictor: Models cache misses as Markov chain states
- Correlation Prefetcher: Learns sequences of correlated cache misses
- Global History Buffer (GHB): Correlates address deltas using program counter
- TCP (Tag Correlation): Correlates cache line tags instead of full addresses
- Reference Prediction Table: Predicts addresses from past miss sequences

### Spatial Patterns

- Spatial Memory Streaming (SMS): Learns spatial patterns within memory regions
- Bingo Spatial Prefetcher: Uses bit-vector footprints for spatial tracking
- DSPatch: Maintains accuracy-biased and coverage-biased footprints

### Machine Learning

- Neural Prefetcher: Combines LSTM models with per-PC linear models
- Perceptron Based Prefetcher: Uses online-trained perceptron for filtering
- LearnCluster: Learns memory access clusters unsupervised
- LearnPrefetch: General-purpose ML-based prefetch prediction

### Advanced Methods

Temporal approaches:
- Temporal Instruction Fetch Streaming: Records and replays instruction sequences
- Temporal Streaming Prefetcher: Learns temporal miss correlations
- Triage: Adaptive temporal prefetching with dynamic metadata sizing

Pattern recognition:
- Domino: Chains first and second-order miss correlations
- Triangel: Combines pattern-based and neighbor-based prediction

Specialized techniques:
- Event-Triggered Programmable: Rule-based prefetching on runtime events
- Feedback-Directed: Adapts prefetch degree based on accuracy metrics
- B-Fetch: Uses branch prediction to guide data prefetching
- Graph Prefetching: Prefetches based on graph traversal semantics
- Translation-Triggered (TEMPO): Uses address translation as prefetch trigger
- Epoch-Based Correlation (EBCP): Learns correlations between quiescence periods
- Store-Ordered Streaming: Records producer streams for consumer prefetching
- Indirect Address (IMP): Learns index-to-target relationships
- Efficient Footprint Caching (F-TDC): Prefetches based on page-level footprints
- Hot Data Stream (HDS): Models bursty access patterns with state machines
- Instruction Pointer Classification (IPCP): Classifies different PC patterns
- Metadata Based: Uses per-PC metadata with confidence tracking
- SPPAM: Combines signature-based delta prediction with access-map extrapolation
- Forest: GPU UVM tree-based neighboring prefetcher with per-object, access-aware tree reconfiguration
- Pythia: Online reinforcement-learning prefetcher that learns prefetch offsets from program context and bandwidth-aware rewards

### Write Your Own Data Loader

Read memory access traces from a file:

```python
from compact.dataloader.dataloader import DataLoader
from compact.prefetchingalgorithm.memoryaccess import MemoryAccess

class MyTraceLoader(DataLoader):
    def __init__(self, filename: str):
        self.filename = filename
        self.data = []
    
    def load(self):
        with open(self.filename) as f:
            for line in f:
                addr, pc = parse_line(line)
                access = MemoryAccess(address=addr, pc=pc)
                self.data.append(access)
    
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)
    
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx]
```

---

## Configure Your Simulation

COMPACT uses YAML files. Here's the basic structure:

```yaml
algorithm: linear

algorithm_config:
  STREAM_BUFFER_SIZE: 32
  PREFETCH_DEGREE: 4

log_file: "output_log.txt"
log_level: INFO
output_format: both
```

Available options:

| Field | Values | What it does |
|-------|--------|-------------|

## How to Add a New Prefetching Algorithm

### Step 1: Create the Prefetcher Class

Create a new file in `compact/prefetchingalgorithm/impl/` (for example, `myprefetcher.py`):

```python
from compact.prefetchingalgorithm.prefetchingalgorithm import PrefetchAlgorithm
from compact.prefetchingalgorithm.memoryaccess import MemoryAccess
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class MyPrefetcher(PrefetchAlgorithm):
    """Description of your prefetcher algorithm."""
    
    def __init__(self, prefetch_degree: int = 4, **kwargs):
        """
        Initialize your prefetcher with parameters.
        
        Args:
            prefetch_degree: Number of cache lines to prefetch ahead
        """
        self.prefetch_degree = prefetch_degree
        self.history = []
    
    def init(self):
        """Initialize state before simulation begins."""
        self.history = []
        logger.info("MyPrefetcher initialized")
    
    def progress(self, access: MemoryAccess, prefetch_hit: bool) -> list:
        """
        Process a single memory access and return predicted addresses.
        
        Args:
            access: Current memory access (contains address, PC, etc.)
            prefetch_hit: Whether this access was a prefetch hit
        
        Returns:
            List of addresses to prefetch
        """
        addr = access.address
        self.history.append(addr)
        
        predictions = []
        if len(self.history) >= 2:
            stride = self.history[-1] - self.history[-2]
            for i in range(1, self.prefetch_degree + 1):
                predictions.append(addr + stride * i)
        
        return predictions
    
    def close(self):
        """Clean up after simulation ends."""
        logger.info(f"MyPrefetcher: Processed {len(self.history)} accesses")
```

### Step 2: Register Your Prefetcher

Edit `compact/config/config_loader.py` and add your algorithm to `AVAILABLE_ALGORITHMS`:

```python
AVAILABLE_ALGORITHMS = {
    # ... existing algorithms ...
    'myprefetcher': 'compact.prefetchingalgorithm.impl.myprefetcher',
}
```

### Step 3: Create a Configuration File

Create `compact/config/configs/sample_myprefetcher.yml`:

```yaml
algorithm: myprefetcher

algorithm_config:
  PREFETCH_DEGREE: 4

log_file: "compact/config/logs/myprefetcher_run.log"
log_level: INFO
output_format: both
```

### Step 4: Test Your Implementation

```bash
# Run your prefetcher
python run.py --config compact/config/configs/sample_myprefetcher.yml

# Write a unit test in tests/prefetchingalgorithm/test_myprefetcher.py
pytest tests/prefetchingalgorithm/test_myprefetcher.py -v
```

---

## What You Get

Simulations produce logs with:

- Correct Predictions: How many prefetch requests hit on future accesses
- Incorrect Predictions: How many prefetches missed
- Prefetch Accuracy: Correct divided by total predictions
- Algorithm Statistics: Algorithm-specific metrics like hit/miss counts

Example log output:

```
INFO: Starting analysis on 1000 data...
DEBUG: Correct: 0x1008
DEBUG: Correct: 0x1010
DEBUG: Incorrect: 0x1018
...
INFO: Correct predictions: 782
INFO: Incorrect predictions: 218
```

Enable debug logging to trace every prediction:

```bash
python run.py --config your_config.yml --log-level DEBUG
```

---

## Test the Code

Run the test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

Test one component:

```bash
pytest tests/prefetchingalgorithm/ -v
```

Test one file:

```bash
pytest tests/prefetchingalgorithm/test_linear.py -v
```

With coverage report:

```bash
pytest --cov=compact tests/
```
